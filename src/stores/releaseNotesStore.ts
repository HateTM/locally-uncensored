 *
 * `lastNotesVersion === null` is genuinely ambiguous: it is what a fresh
 * install looks like AND what an upgrade from any build before this feature
 * existed looks like, because the store did not exist there either. That is why
 * onboarding is the second signal and why the stamp happens at the END of
 * onboarding rather than at startup:
 *
 *   fresh install   -> onboarding runs -> finish() stamps the current version
 *                      -> null never survives to be read as "upgraded"
 *   upgrade to 2.6.3 -> onboarding does not run -> nothing stamps
 *                      -> null means "has not seen 2.6.3 notes" -> show
 *
 * The NSIS-recovery path in AppShell that flips onboardingDone back on for a
 * user whose settings were reset deliberately does NOT stamp: that user is an
 * upgrader and has notes coming.
