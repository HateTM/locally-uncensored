// GH #146 (joshmichael, 2026-10-01): two LoRAs deleted from models/loras stayed
// in the persisted stack. The picker showed "2 active" with nothing ticked,
// every run sent them, and ComfyUI refused the graph with "Value not in list".
// One of them was a Z-Image character LoRA riding into the Animate lane.
// This file decides, from the one list ComfyUI reports, which picks a run uses
// and which LoRAs the stack offers for the model that is picked.
