// LTX 2.5 multishot: several shots with the same figure in one run.
//
// How the model takes it, read off the vendor's own docs on 2026-10-02:
// docs.ltx.io, Open Source Model, Usage Guides, Prompting Guide, section
// "Multi-Shot Prompts". There is no separate input and no tag syntax. The
// scene is ONE chronological paragraph in which every cut is written out in
// plain words ("A hard cut transitions to ..."), each new shot says its own
// framing, and a recurring person is described the same way again. The guide
// says to prefer two to four shots and NOT to use a shot list, numbered beats
// or sluglines unless the cut is also described in prose. ComfyUI's LTX-2.5
// templates list "Native multishot" the same way: it is a property of the
// prompt, not of a node.
//
// So the shot list in the advanced settings is a form for that paragraph. The
// prompt field is shot 1, every further shot is one more sentence block, and
// each cut is named in prose. There is no per shot length: the guide has no
// syntax for one, the clip length stays the one length slider.
