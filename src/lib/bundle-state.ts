/**
 * What a bundle card should say: Installed, Installing, Retry or Get.
 *
 * GH #113, JonnFlauty on Windows 11 with an RTX 5070 Ti: a video download
 * failed midway, he retried, and afterwards the model "doesn't shown in the
 * installed section and for some reason every model in the list shown retry".
 *
 * The download store is keyed by FILENAME, and bundles share files. Seven of
 * the thirteen video bundles ship the same umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled text
 * encoder and six the same wan_2.1_vae, so one attempt on one bundle writes
 * rows that every other bundle in the list then reads as if they were about
 * itself:
 *
 *   - one error row on a shared file made every bundle carrying that filename
 *     count as NOT installed, even the ones sitting complete on disk, because
 *     the error veto ran before the disk answer;
 *   - one FINISHED shared file made every bundle carrying it look half
 *     downloaded, which is the Retry button on every card in the list.
 *
 * So the rule is: the disk is the only source that speaks about this bundle
 * and nothing else, and a download row only says something about this bundle
 * when it is about a file this bundle is still missing.
 *
 * Pure on purpose. The component holds the store and the disk verdicts; the
 * decision is here where it can be proven without either.
