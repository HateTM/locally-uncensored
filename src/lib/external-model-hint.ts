// lapbo, Discord 2026-09-28 ("DELETE BUTTON"): the chat rows without a bin
// are models another app serves, LM Studio in his screenshot. LM Studio has
// no delete in its API or in `lms`, and its model list names no file, so LU
// cannot delete them without guessing which file is meant. David decided on
// 2026-10-01: the row says where the model is deleted instead.
