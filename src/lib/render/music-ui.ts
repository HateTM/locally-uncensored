// What the Music tab offers and may claim, per backend and per model.
//
// #108 (ElBiggus) was a page of cloud facts printed at a local user: the tab
// said the model writes its own lyrics while hiding the lyrics box, the how-to
// described a box that was not there, promised other downloadable music
// models, and said the length slider "bills per second" on a machine where
// nothing is billed. The copy lives here so those claims can be asserted
// instead of eyeballed.
//
// In the cloud the answer comes from the model itself (the web twin is
// apps/web/lib/render/music-surface.ts). The classic music models take a
// length in seconds and bill by it. A Studio music model carries its own
// schema: one has a length field in milliseconds, the others have none at all,
// and for two of them the prompt field is the lyrics. The tab shows a control
// only where the run reads it, and sets exactly the field the run sends.
