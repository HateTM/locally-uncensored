 * refusal stands in the history, models that would have answered copy it in
 * the same chat. The way out is a new chat, so the app says that under the
 * refusing answer, in Cloud and in local chat alike, and offers the new chat
 * right there.
 *
 * A refusal is a SHORT answer that OPENS with a refusal phrase. Both halves
 * are needed: a long answer that starts with "I can't" usually goes on to do
 * the work, and a story may hold "I cannot help you" in the middle of a
 * dialogue. Neither is a refusal of the request.
