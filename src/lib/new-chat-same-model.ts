 * A new chat on the model the user is chatting with right now. The button

 * refusal stays behind in the old chat, the model comes along.

 * The picked model is the one that answers in the open chat, the store keeps
 * the two in step (modelStore.setActiveModel). The persona rule is the one of
 * the sidebar's New Chat.
 *
 * Without a picked model there is nothing to carry over. The landing page
 * opens instead, with the composer and the model picker in it.
