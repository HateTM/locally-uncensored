/**
 * The refusal notice under an answer (David, 2026-10-05).
 *
 * Measured that day: a refusal in the history is copied by better models in
 * the same chat. The app says so under the refusing answer. This file pins
 * what counts as a refusal: a SHORT answer that OPENS with a refusal phrase,
 * judged on finished model answers only, and marked once per chat.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/refusal-detect.test.ts
