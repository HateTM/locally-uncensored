// Pending tool approvals, per conversation, at MODULE scope (G29b).
//
// Same lesson as agentLoopTimer in useAgentChat (audit A3): the chat view
// unmounts on a view switch, so anything the run needs after that point cannot
// live in a hook ref. The approval queue did, so a run that asked for approval
// after the switch pushed into the queue of the DEAD instance and told a
// component that no longer exists to show it. The remounted hook started with
// an empty queue, the user saw nothing to approve, and the run waited forever.
// G29 gave that user a Stop button back; this gives them the actual choice.
//
// Keyed by conversation because the queue outlives the view: a run continuing
// in one chat must never surface its approval in another chat the user has
// since opened.
//
// The FIFO itself is the older fix that must survive (Phase 5): parallel tool
// execution means several tools can ask in the same batch, and a single slot
// would be overwritten by the second asker, deadlocking the first.
